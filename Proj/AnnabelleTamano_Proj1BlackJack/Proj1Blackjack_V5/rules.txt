Blackjack (Single Player) Rules
  - The overall premise is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
  - To start the game you must place a bet at minimum $20 and at maximum $2000.
  - Certain cards are worth different values. Face cards (K,Q,J) are worth 10.
    Aces are worth 1 OR 11 (Whichever adds to a better hand). The rest of
    cards are worth the number that they display.
  - Both you and the dealer start with two cards, however one of the
    dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
  - At each play you have one of two options. First, you can 'Hit' which
    is just asking for another card. OR you can 'Stand' which
    signifies holding your total and ending your turn.
  - If the value of your cards go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins
    regardless of their hand. Thus, you lose all the money that you bet.
  - If you are dealt 21 from the start, you got a blackjack! Therefore, you
    automatically win back 1.5x the value of your bet.
  - The dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher. Both your hands
    will be compared, and if you beat the dealer's hand you win back 1.5x the
    value of your original bet. Else, you lose the value of your original bet.
  - If you tie with the dealer or if your dealer busts, you neither win
    nor lose, and you get no money back.
  - NOTE: In order to simplify the game, this version does not deal with
    splits or doubles.
Card Display Format
  - Each card will be printed encapsulated by brackets [].
  - First, the card name {A(Ace),2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T(10),J(Jack),Q(Queen),K(King)}
    will be printed.
  - Then a character representative of the card's suit {C(Clubs),H(Hearts),
    D(Diamonds),S(Spades)} will be printed in the bracket.
  - Example: [ A C ] represents the card "Ace of Clubs."
